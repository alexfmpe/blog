# Data science

Data is the foundation of our ability to analyse and understand the world. Given the ongoing
increase in computing power available to humanity, and the resultant increase in our ability to
collect and process large quantities of data, it is no surprise that data science and the associated
fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are so pervasive. Queensland has
recognised this and are investing heavily in our data driven future.

However, there are significant problems with the way we currently deal with data. If not addressed,
these problems and their impact will grow; at best slowing our progress, at worst causing calamity.
We see the two biggest problems being the use of proprietary formats, and the lack of robust
programming models. As a result, we aim to improve the state of data science by using functional
programming to produce and contribute to open source software for use in data science.
